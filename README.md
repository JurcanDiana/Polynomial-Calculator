# Polynomial-Calculator

This project is a GUI application developed using Java Swing, the objective being to propose, design and implement a system of processing polynomials of a single variable, with integer coefficients. In other words, it is a mini application that can process operations with a maximum of two polynomials, operations such as: addition, subtraction, derivation, and integration.

This calculation system has as input data of two polynomials, and as output data we have the result generated after performing one of the operations. In addition, the application also has a graphical user-friendly interface, made in order to facilitate the use, and to make the use of the application as clear as possible.

The code is organized using the MVC architecture and for extracting the polynomial coefficients, regular expressions and pattern matching is used. For checking the accuracy of the implementation, JUnit tests are used.
